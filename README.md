# AIR-QUALITY-ANALYSIS
This document proposes a framework for air quality analysis in Tamil Nadu. The framework consists of the following modules:
Data collection and preprocessing: This module will collect data from various sources, such as government monitoring stations, satellite imagery, and citizen sensors. The data will then be preprocessed to ensure that it is consistent and of high quality.
Air quality modeling: This module will use the preprocessed data to develop air quality models. The models will be used to predict air quality levels at different locations and times.
Air quality visualization: This module will visualize the air quality data and model predictions in a user-friendly way. The visualizations will be used to communicate air quality information to the public and policymakers.
Air quality forecasting: This module will use the air quality models to forecast air quality levels for future days. The forecasts will be used to help people plan their activities and protect themselves from air pollution.
